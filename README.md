## Recipe Finder

Recipe Finder is a web application developed using Ruby on Rails. It is my first web application developed in RoR, as part of my independent studies.

Recipe Finder uses [Food2Fork](http://food2fork.com/about/api "F2F API Page") web API to search for recipes published on the web (from different publishers) and returns the search results in formatted data (i.e. JSON). 

## Versions

- Ruby 2.3.1
- Rails 4.2.3
- Full list of gems found in the Gemfile
